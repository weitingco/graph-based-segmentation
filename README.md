# graph-based-segmentation

# Usage
1. Run 'buildMex.m'
2. Run 'TestSeg.m' and see result


## TODO
### fix MATLAB interface: compile multiple .cpp files to mex and bypass .txt files [Steven]
### Android implementation

-Interface

-Algorithm [Weiting]

### Graph construction in different space

-Nearest neighbor search in (x,y,r,g,b) [TJ]

-In other spaces

### Comparison with other implemenations
C++ code:
http://cs.brown.edu/~pff/segment/
Matlab code:
http://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/29299-efficient-graph-based-image-segmentation

### Think about video segmentation (using time to help)
~~### Prepare slides for presentation (BY TUESDAY!!!!) [Steven]~~


## Maybe do
-use boost for disjoint set
-shape recognition for object tracking
