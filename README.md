# graph-based-segmentation
THIS is EVILLLLLLLLL

## TODO
### fix MATLAB interface: compile multiple .cpp files to mex and bypass .txt files
### Android implementation
-Interface
-Algorithm
### Graph construction in different space
-Nearest neighbor search in (x,y,r,g,b)
-In other spaces
### Comparison with other implemenations
### Think about video segmentation (using time to help)
### Prepare slides for presentation (BY TUESDAY!!!!)


## Maybe do
-use boost for disjoint set
-shape recognition for object tracking
